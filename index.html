			<h1>Learn minimal web design and development with me, Garrett Mickley.</h1>

			<p>I had the perfect client.</p>

			<p>His project was interesting. He showed up to meetings on time. He sent me information I needed when requested. He didn&#39;t complain. He didn&#39;t even argue the price of the contract.</p>

			<p>But I wasn&#39;t having fun.</p>

			<p>It wasn&#39;t because of him or the project. It was because I realized one day...</p>

			<p>I&#39;m tired of marketing.</p>

			<p>I&#39;ve been doing it for almost 10 years now. At this point, my processes are down. I repeat the processes and I know that traffic will grow and sales increase.</p>

			<p>I&#39;ve done before, and I can do it again and again.</p>

			<p>When I get a client that challenges me, they&#39;re only a challenge because they&#39;re boring.</p>

			<p>I swear, if I have to write copy for one more printer ink/toner I will go insane.</p>

			<p>I don&#39;t want to do it anymore. I don&#39;t want to market other people.</p>

			<p>I realized it at the seanwes conference last week in Austin, Texas. It was a blast. I reconnected with some old friends and made some new ones. I even found a secret bar with a secret code, a bar behind a bookshelf, and a bar made out of old shipping containers.</p>

			<p>But those are stories for in person (buy me a beer and I&#39;ll tell you all about them).</p>

			<p>One night, the conference put on an amazing taco/fajita dinner for us. It was so good.</p>

			<p>Right at the end of the night, I met this dude <a href="https://tommorkes.com/" target="_blank">Tom Morkes</a>.</p>

			<p>He&#39;s a brilliant guy and has worked with a lot of important people and companies. He told me my niche, local artists who want to take their art online, is broke. They don&#39;t have enough money for me to consistently build a business out of it. I&#39;ll end up working way more than I do now for the same amount of money, or less.</p>

			<p>He was right.</p>

			<p>He suggested I try something like dentists. They&#39;ve got money and don&#39;t know how to market their sites. Plus there are tons of them.</p>

			<p>I got excited. He was right. I could charge them a lot more than I do artists.</p>

			<p>By the next morning I was feeling pretty depressed. I didn&#39;t want to market dentists. To be honest, I didn&#39;t want to market artists. I don&#39;t want to market anything but my own stuff...and even that I&#39;d love to hire someone else to do for me.</p>

			<p>I&#39;m burnt out on marketing. It&#39;s time for a career change.</p>

			<p>I&#39;m going to pursue something I&#39;ve been interested in since middle school. In 8th grade, I &quot;built&quot; my first website on Geocities.</p>

			<p>I&#39;m declaring right now that at least until January 1st, 2020, I won&#39;t focus on anything else other than learning web design and development.</p>

			<p>At that point, I will decide if I want to stick with it or try something else. Until then, I will give it everything I&#39;ve got for 2 years. Even if I decide I don&#39;t like it and don&#39;t want to pursue it, I&#39;ll at least have the skills and knowledge and can apply them to something else.</p>

			<h2>That&#39;s what this site is about.</h2>

			<p>This website is a way for you to learn about web design and development, with &quot;minimal&quot; aesthetics, while I&#39;m learning.</p>

			<p>We will be learning together here.</p>

			<p>One thing I believe is &quot;ship early; ship often&quot;, &quot;done is better than perfect&quot;, &quot;just fucking ship it&quot;, or however you want to word that particular concept.</p>

			<p>The idea is: get it out there. That&#39;s what I&#39;m doing with this website. That&#39;s why it looks like this right now.</p>

			<p>Something I used to always do was just install WordPress, grab a free or cheap theme, and make minor edits. It&#39;s high on my to-do list to learn WordPress development, but the point of this site is to share the journey of learning web design and development, so I won&#39;t be installing WordPress here for a while yet.</p>

			<p>Everything I do will be posted on github as well as in blog posts to share the learning process.</p>
